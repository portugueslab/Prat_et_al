# Comparing the representation of a simple visual stimulus across the cerebellar network

Analysis code and notebooks for the analysis and figures of the paper "Comparing the representation of a simple visual stimulus across the cerebellar network" (Prat, Petrucco, Å tih, Portugues).

The `luminance_analysis` module contains all utility functions used throughout the repository, for loading and organizing the data and performing its analysis as well as for making the plots in the manuscript.

Code to replicate all plots from the manuscript can be found in the `figures_notebooks` folder.

The code to perform the fitting of the model described in Figure 7 can be found in the `modeling` folder, and the one for all the decoding analysis can be found in `decoding`.
